Object oriented programming assignment 

Book & Vehicle OOP Example

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python using two activities:

üìò Activity 1: Book & EBook

Defines a Book class with attributes like title, author, and total_pages.

A method read() lets the user simulate reading pages.

Defines an EBook class that inherits from Book and adds a file_size attribute.

Demonstrates inheritance (child class extends parent class) and method overriding.

üöó Activity 2: Vehicles

Defines a Vehicle base class with a method move().

Creates subclasses Car, Plane, and Boat, each with its own version of move().

Demonstrates polymorphism: different classes provide their own behavior for the same method.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Copy the Python code into a file named main.py (or any .py file).

Run the program in your terminal with:

python main.py


You will see outputs for reading books/ebooks and different vehicle movements.
